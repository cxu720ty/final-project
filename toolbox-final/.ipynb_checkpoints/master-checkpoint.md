# Here is Crystal's Final Project Assignment 8 - Data analysis of Disney 

In this analysis, I will be investigating Disney movie Directors to determine the total gross and average gross (adjusted for inflation) of the movies they have directed. I am interested in finding out which Director(s) have the highest average gross income for the movies they directed. This is interesting because disney is no longer strictly associated to animated films, but have expended into the Marvel Universe and the Star Wars Universe. It would be interesting to know if any directors have directed films from all genre of movie as well as comparing the highest grossing directors across Disney's long history of movie making.
